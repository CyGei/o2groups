# Overview

Effective outbreak control relies on a comprehensive understanding of
how diseases spread between affected groups, such as healthcare workers
and patients or specific age groups.

We developed an estimator that utilises information on transmission
chains (who infected whom), enabling the identification and
quantification of transmission patterns between groups (see package
[`linktree`](https://github.com/CyGei/linktree))

The `o2groups` package provides a framework for simulating outbreaks
using branching processes specifically designed for scenarios involving
multiple groups with various transmission assortativity coefficients
(`gamma`).

The package is still under development and is not yet available on CRAN.

# Installation

``` r
pacman::p_load_gh("CyGei/o2groups")
```

# The assortativity coefficient

By quantifying the extent to which individuals transmit infections
within their own groups, assortativity coefficients offer a means to
measure the relative contributions of different groups to transmission.
$\gamma$ is defined as the excess probability of a secondary infection
taking place within group a compared to random expectations. $\gamma$
values range from 0 (fully disassortative) to âˆž (fully assortative),
with 1 indicating homogeneous patterns. For instance, $\gamma$ = 2
indicates that an infected individual from group a is twice as likely to
infect an individual from the same group compared to an individual from
another group. Conversely, a $\gamma$ of 1/2 means that an infected
individual from group a is twice as likely to infect an individual from
another group compared to an individual from the same group.

# Example

## Simulation

We first specify the input parameters for our simulation.

``` r
set.seed(123)
duration = 100
group_n = 2
size = c(100, 400)
name = c("HCW", "patient")
gamma = c(2, 0.8)
intro_n = c(1, 3) 
r0 = c(1.7, 2) 
generation_time = c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0) 
incubation_period = sample(1:14, sum(size), replace = TRUE) 
```

We then run the outbreak simulation using the `simulate_groups`
function.

``` r
set.seed(123)
sim <- simulate_groups(
  duration = duration,
  group_n = group_n,
  size = size,
  name = name,
  gamma = gamma,
  intro_n = intro_n,
  r0 = r0,
  generation_time = generation_time,
  incubation_period = incubation_period
)
head(sim)
```

## Estimation using [`linktree`](https://github.com/CyGei/linktree)

``` r
pacman::p_load_gh("CyGei/linktree")
est <- get_gamma(
  from = sim$source_group,
  to = sim$group,
  f = setNames(size/sum(size), name)
  )

plot(est)
```
